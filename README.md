📌 Project Overview
Maintaining a balanced moisture level is crucial for plant health. This system uses a Soil Moisture Sensor to monitor soil conditions and a Solenoid Water Pump to provide water only when necessary. It prevents under-watering and over-watering, ensuring healthier plant growth.

Key Features:
🌡 Soil Moisture Sensing: Detects soil humidity using an X14.86062 sensor.
🚰 Automatic Watering: Pumps water only when needed using K22.SOLEPOMP.
🔋 Battery-Powered: Uses a rechargeable 18650 Li-Ion Battery with a TP4056 charging module.
📈 Efficient Power Management: MT3608 voltage booster provides stable operation.

⚙️ Components Used:
  Component	                                                Function
Arduino Uno	                                            Microcontroller
X14.86062 Soil  Moisture Sensor                        	Detects soil humidity
K22.SOLEPOMP Solenoid Pump	                            Controls water flow
MT3608 Voltage Booster	                                Adjusts voltage for pump operation
TP4056 Charging Module	                                Charges the Li-Ion battery
18650 Li-Ion Battery	                                  Provides power to the system

🛠️ How It Works
Soil Moisture Sensor measures the soil's humidity level.
If the humidity level is below a threshold, the Arduino Uno triggers the water pump.
Water is pumped into the soil until the required moisture level is reached.
The system runs on a rechargeable Li-Ion battery, making it portable and energy-efficient.
